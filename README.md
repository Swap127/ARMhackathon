This repository consists of ARM hackathon "My journey to the moon". My journey is almost complete as The spaceship will travel in the right path
if it is in the gravitational field of the Earth or Moon. Only the connection between these two is missing.

The Earth(spiral1) is at (0,0) with radius 1440
The Moon(spiral2) is at (2500,2500) with radius 360
